# gAssist
A Google Assistant client for Windows

### Notice of potential depreciation:
According to *[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18187992/microsoft-cortana-satya-nadella-alexa-google-assistant-competitor)*, Microsoft may be planning to integrate Google Assistant into Cortana (and vise-verca) as it did with Amazon's Alexa.
If Microsoft or Google confirms this integration, gAssist will no longer be supported.
Also due to this, gAssist 2 will no longer be in development. There are many, many major bugs in gAssist 2 that are preventing me from being able to release it, even as a beta. Because of this, I'll be working on upgrades for gAssist 1 instead of switching to the new gAssist 2 framework.

Sorry about the delays for gAssist upgrades. A new release should be ready by March (at the latest).
