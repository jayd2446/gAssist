# google-assistant
A Google Assistant client for Windows.
**This project does not support Python 2 and is no longer active**

# Usage
When you launch the app, you should get a setup screen. If you don't have Python 3 installed, make sure you install it, and check the box that says add to PATH. When you get the setup completed screen, relaunch the app. Then, wait for the microphone icon to appear at the bottom. This shouldn't take more than a minute, and is usually about 3 seconds. When you click the microphone icon, it should turn black. Start speaking to the assistant. You should get a live transcript of what you are saying in a grey circle. When the assistant detects that you are done speaking, a responce will be said and displayed on screen. 

# Debugging
Before following debugging steps, make sure your microphone is on and working!

##### Debugging setup
Open the menu, click debug, then click show log in setup. Copy and paste the log in a new GitHub issue explaining the problem you are having. 

##### Debugging speaking to the assistant
Open the menu, click terminate assistant sdk, then click launch assistant sdk in debug mode. Try speaking to the assistant, then screenshot or copy and paste the log into a new GitHub issue.


# News and updates
As soon as the new Google Assistant smart display SDK is released (probably summer or later), this app will be updated to support it.
